### My name is Alia Mahama-Rodriguez and I'm a Biomedical Engineer with a selected interest in Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Neurogenomics/Neuroinformatics.



My research primarily focuses on movement disorders and the application of mathematical methods to better understand them. In particular, I use various physiological sensing modalities to record neuromuscular and kinematic activity, and then apply nonlinear signal processing techniques to identify the factors underlying the dysfunction.

My research primarily focuses on perturbation neurology while incorporating biomathematics and computational modeling to comprehensively profile and model mechanisms involved in neuropsychiatric conditions.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I play the violin and theremin when I'm not coding. I also founded a non-profit based in Dallas catered towards providing free and accessible trauma-informed yoga to populations susceptible to cPTSD, trauma, etc (e.g. veterans, domestic and sexual assault victims, homeless community, incarcerated inmates). I am also an active artist; having worked in Contemporary Art spaces before pursuing Engineering, I've meshed my technical skills in computational modeling with generative art to produce ready-made prints.



an approach to creating a safe, supportive space in which students can learn emotional regulation skills through connection with the breath and increased body awareness.
