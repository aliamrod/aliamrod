### Hello there, I'm Alia Mahama-Rodriguez! I am a Biomedical Engineer turned Computational Neuroscientist and Neuroinformatician. I love tinkering with all things Data and Software Development. 

I am also interested in perturbation neurology and computational modeling to comprehensively profile and model mechanisms involved in neuropsychiatric conditions.
